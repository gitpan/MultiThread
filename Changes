Revision history for MultiThread

0.9    Dec 3, 2008
        - Added ability to nest WorkerPools inside of a Pipeline.
        - Added worker_count method to MultiThread::WorkerPool.
        - $$ticket{Response} from get_response() will now be an arrayref
            containing the return values as returned by the final worker sub. 
            Previously this only handled a single return value.
        - Several documentation fixes and additions.
